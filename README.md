This is a machine-learning solution for predicting a player's "Next WAR" statistic. The notebook imports data, cleans the non numerical, null values, and players with <=1 season played. The data is then is padded with a Next_WAR column that then is filled by the [+1] index of the WAR category, edge cases are excluded.  The model chosen is Ridge Reduction Model, forward passing grouping techniques were used based on increasing data frame by "season" against predictions. Once evaluated with Mean Squared Error the function player_history groups a WAR_correlation, WAR_diff for improved measurements for further optimization techniques
